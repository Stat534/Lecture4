# Overview of Point Level Models

## Visual Motivation
```{r, out.width = "80%", echo = F, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap='source: airnow.gov'}

```

## Basic Notation

- The response, $Y(\boldsymbol{s})$, is a random variable at location(s) $\boldsymbol{s}$
- $\boldsymbol{s}$ varies continuously over the space
- Typically, $\boldsymbol{s} \in \mathcal{R}^2$ or $\boldsymbol{s} \in \mathcal{D}$, where $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathcal{R}^2$, such as Montana.
- $Y(\boldsymbol{s})$ is a stochastic process, or a collection of random variables.
- In spatial settings, $Y(\boldsymbol{s})$ is referred to as a *spatial process*.

## Conceptual Challenge: Questions
#### Goals

- Inference about spatial process $Y(\boldsymbol{s})$
- Create a continous map of air quality, or more generally predict the response at new locations given the partial realization of the process

#### Discussion Questions
- What is the dimension of the spatial process, $Y(\boldsymbol{s})$?
- How are predictions made at unsampled locations, and a related question, what does "inference about a spatial process" mean?


## Conceptual Challenge: Solutions
#### Goals

> - Inference about spatial process $Y(\boldsymbol{s})$
> - Create a continous map of air quality, or more generally predict the response at new locations given the partial realization of the process

#### Discussion Questions
> - What is the dimension of the spatial process, $Y(\boldsymbol{s})$?
<small>It is defined across the entire space, so infinite dimensional.</small>
- How are predictions made at unsampled locations, and a related question, what does "inference about a spatial process" mean?
<small> the spatial process is assumed to have mean (or covariate) properties as well as a specified covariance structure as a function of distance. Similar to a standard regression model, predictions are made using the covariates and covariance. </small>

## Spatial Covariance
- Spatial covariance is characterized by the distance between locations
- With a structured covariance, few parameters are necessary
- A covariance function must be symmetric:  $Cov(Y(\boldsymbol{s}_1),Y(\boldsymbol{s}_2)) = Cov(Y(\boldsymbol{s}_2),Y(\boldsymbol{s}_1))$
- A common covariance is the exponential covariance, where
$$Cov(Y(\boldsymbol{s}_1),Y(\boldsymbol{s}_2)) = \sigma^2 \exp(-\phi d_{12}),$$
where $d_{12}$ is the distance between $\boldsymbol{s}_1$ and $\boldsymbol{s}_2$.

## Exponential Covariance: Questions
The exponential covariance function has two parameters:

$$Cov(Y(\boldsymbol{s}_1),Y(\boldsymbol{s}_2)) = \sigma^2 \exp(-\phi d_{12}),$$

Describe the how the parameters contribute to the covariance:

> - $\phi$
> - $\sigma^2$


## Exponential Covariance: Solution
The exponential covariance function has two parameters:

$$Cov(Y(\boldsymbol{s}_1),Y(\boldsymbol{s}_2)) = \sigma^2 \exp(-\phi d_{12}),$$

Describe the how the parameters contribute to the covariance:

- $\phi$: <small> controls the correlation. In particular, $\exp(-\phi d_{12})$ will be between 0 and 1 (with $\phi > 0$ and $d_{12} \geq 0$). When $d_{12}  \gg \frac{1}{\phi},$ the correlation goes to zero and When $d_{12}  \ll \frac{1}{\phi},$ the correlation goes to one. $\frac{1}{\phi}$ is known as the *range parameter*. </small>
- $\sigma^2$: <small> is a scaling parameter associated with the correlation. $\sigma^2$ is called the partial sill </small>


## Joint Distribution
A joint distribution is specified to model the spatial covariance using standard likelihood-based techniques.

- Let $\boldsymbol{Y} := \{Y(\boldsymbol{s}_i) \}$ for locations $\boldsymbol{s_i}, i = 1, \dots, n$
- Then assume 
$$\boldsymbol{Y}|\mu, \boldsymbol{\theta} \sim MVN_n(\mu \boldsymbol{1}_n, \Sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta})),$$
where $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is a vector of parameters that determine the variance.

## Parameter Estimation: Questions
- Write out the likelihood for $\boldsymbol{Y}$
- Describe the process for estimating the parameters in the model

## Parameter Estimation: Solutions
> - Write out the likelihood for $\boldsymbol{Y}$:
<small>$$\boldsymbol{Y}|\mu, \boldsymbol{\theta} = (2 \pi) ^{n/2} |\Sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta})|^{-1/2} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{Y} - \boldsymbol{1}\mu)^T \Sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta})^{-1} (\boldsymbol{Y} - \boldsymbol{1}\mu) \right]$$</small>
> - Describe the process for estimating the parameters in the model
<small> maximum likelihood for $\mu$, and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ or
with Bayesian techniques using prior distributions and Markov Chain Monte Carlo</small>
