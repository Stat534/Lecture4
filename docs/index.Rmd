## Class Intro
 
>- What did we learn last time?

- For Today
    - What is point referenced data?
    - How do we predict the response at unobserved locations?

# Overview of Point Level Models or Geostatistical Models

## Visual Motivation
```{r, out.width = "80%", echo = F, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap='source: airnow.gov'}
knitr::include_graphics("MT_Air.png") 
```

## Basic Notation

- The response, $Y(\boldsymbol{s})$, is a random variable at location(s) $\boldsymbol{s}$
- $\boldsymbol{s}$ varies continuously over the space
- Typically, $\boldsymbol{s} \in \mathcal{R}^2$ or $\boldsymbol{s} \in \mathcal{D}$, where $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathcal{R}^2$, such as Montana.
- $Y(\boldsymbol{s})$ is a stochastic process, or a collection of random variables.
- In spatial settings, $Y(\boldsymbol{s})$ is referred to as a *spatial process*.

## Conceptual Challenge: Questions
#### Goals

- Inference about spatial process $Y(\boldsymbol{s})$
- Create a continous map of air quality, or more generally predict the response at new locations given the partial realization of the process

#### Discussion Questions
- What is the dimension of the spatial process, $Y(\boldsymbol{s})$?
- How are predictions made at unsampled locations, and a related question, what does "inference about a spatial process" mean?


## Conceptual Challenge: Solutions
#### Goals

> - Inference about spatial process $Y(\boldsymbol{s})$
> - Create a continous map of air quality, or more generally predict the response at new locations given the partial realization of the process

#### Discussion Questions
> - What is the dimension of the spatial process, $Y(\boldsymbol{s})$?
<small>It is defined across the entire space, so infinite dimensional.</small>
- How are predictions made at unsampled locations, and a related question, what does "inference about a spatial process" mean?
<small> the spatial process is assumed to have mean (or covariate) properties as well as a specified covariance structure as a function of distance. Similar to a standard regression model, predictions are made using the covariates and covariance. </small>

## Spatial Covariance
- Spatial covariance is characterized by the distance between locations
- By specifying a structured form for the covariance function, few parameters are necessary
- A covariance function must be symmetric:  $Cov(Y(\boldsymbol{s}_1),Y(\boldsymbol{s}_2)) = Cov(Y(\boldsymbol{s}_2),Y(\boldsymbol{s}_1))$
- A common covariance is the exponential covariance, where
$$Cov(Y(\boldsymbol{s}_1),Y(\boldsymbol{s}_2)) = \sigma^2 \exp(-\phi d_{12}),$$
where $d_{12}$ is the distance between $\boldsymbol{s}_1$ and $\boldsymbol{s}_2$.

## Exponential Covariance: Questions
The exponential covariance function has two parameters:

$$Cov(Y(\boldsymbol{s}_1),Y(\boldsymbol{s}_2)) = \sigma^2 \exp(-\phi d_{12}),$$

Describe the how the parameters contribute to the covariance:

> - $\phi$
> - $\sigma^2$


## Exponential Covariance: Solution
The exponential covariance function has two parameters:

$$Cov(Y(\boldsymbol{s}_1),Y(\boldsymbol{s}_2)) = \sigma^2 \exp(-\phi d_{12}),$$

Describe the how the parameters contribute to the covariance:

- $\phi$: <small> controls the correlation. In particular, $\exp(-\phi d_{12})$ will be between 0 and 1 (with $\phi > 0$ and $d_{12} \geq 0$). When $d_{12}  \gg \frac{1}{\phi},$ the correlation goes to zero and When $d_{12}  \ll \frac{1}{\phi},$ the correlation goes to one. $\frac{1}{\phi}$ is known as the *range parameter*. </small>
- $\sigma^2$: <small> is a scaling parameter associated with the correlation. $\sigma^2$ is called the partial sill </small>

## Exponential Covariance: Nugget
- Spatial models include a *nugget* effect to account point level variability. This can be thought of as measurement error, or randomness inherent in the process.

- Hence for a single point,
$$Cov(Y(\boldsymbol{s}_i),Y(\boldsymbol{s}_i)) = \sigma^2 \exp(-\phi d_{12}) + \tau^2,$$
- In this setting, $\sigma^2 + \tau^2$ is called the *sill*.

## Joint Distribution
A joint distribution is specified to model the spatial covariance using standard likelihood-based techniques.

- Let $\boldsymbol{Y} := \{Y(\boldsymbol{s}_i) \}$ for locations $\boldsymbol{s_i}, i = 1, \dots, n$
- Then assume 
$$\boldsymbol{Y}|\mu, \boldsymbol{\theta} \sim MVN_n(\mu \boldsymbol{1}_n, \Sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta})),$$
where $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is a vector of parameters that determine the variance.

## Parameter Estimation: Questions
- Write out the likelihood for $\boldsymbol{Y}$
- Describe the process for estimating the parameters in the model

## Parameter Estimation: Solutions
> - Write out the likelihood for $\boldsymbol{Y}$:
<small>$$\boldsymbol{Y}|\mu, \boldsymbol{\theta} = (2 \pi) ^{n/2} |\Sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta})|^{-1/2} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{Y} - \boldsymbol{1}\mu)^T \Sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta})^{-1} (\boldsymbol{Y} - \boldsymbol{1}\mu) \right]$$</small>
> - Describe the process for estimating the parameters in the model
<small> maximum likelihood for $\mu$, and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ or
with Bayesian techniques using prior distributions and Markov Chain Monte Carlo</small>

## Gaussian Process

Given that we assume $$\boldsymbol{Y}|\mu, \boldsymbol{\theta} \sim MVN_n(\mu \boldsymbol{1}_n, \Sigma(\boldsymbol{\theta})),$$

- it is also reasonable to assume that the response at a set of unobserved locations, $\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s^*})$ also follows a multivariate normal distribution.
- this results in an infinite dimensional normal distribution, which is also know as a Gaussian Process (GP)
- prediction, say $\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s^*})|\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s})$ follows a conditional multivariate normal distribution


# Elements of Geostatistical models

## Stationarity

>- Assume the spatial process, $\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s})$ has a mean, $\boldsymbol{\mu}(\boldsymbol{s})$, and that the variance of $\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s})$ exists everywhere.
- The process is __strictly stationary__ if: for any $n \geq 1$, any set of $n$ sites $\{\boldsymbol{s}_1, \dots, \boldsymbol{s}_n\}$ and any $\boldsymbol{h} \in \mathcal{R}^r$ (typically r =2), the distribution of $(\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s}_1). \dots, \boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s+h}_n))$ is the same as $\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s+h}_1)$

## Strict Stationarity
Is this strictly stationary?
```{r}
# Data
a <- data.frame( x=rnorm(20000, 0, .5), y=rnorm(20000, 1, .5) )
b <- data.frame( x=rnorm(20000, 2, 1), y=rnorm(20000, -.5, 1) )
c <- data.frame( x=rnorm(20000, -.5, 1), y=rnorm(20000, 0, 1) )
data <- rbind(a,b,c)

ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y) ) +
  stat_density_2d(aes(fill = ..density..), geom = "raster", contour = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette= "Spectral", direction=1) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  theme(
    legend.position='none'
  )
```


## Weak Stationarity
>- Weak stationarity, or second-order stationarity of a spatial process, requires a constant mean and covariance that is a function of $\boldsymbol{h}$, $Cov(\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s}),\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s +h})) = C(\boldsymbol{h}),$ where $C(\boldsymbol{h})$ is a covariance function that only requires the distance between the points.
- Typically with spatial models, the process is assumed to be mean zero as covariates explain the mean structure. So second-order stationarity is primarily focused on the covariance structure.


## Weak Stationarity
Is this weakly stationary?
```{r}
# Data
dat <- rep(0,100)
dat[1:100 %%2 == 1] <- sample(x = c(1,-1), size = 50, replace =T)
dat[1:100 %%2 == 0] <- rnorm(50)
comb <- data.frame(dat = dat, n = 1:100)
ggplot(comb, aes(x=n, y=dat) ) +
  geom_point() + geom_line() + theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
        axis.title.y=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank())
```

## Intrinsic Stationarity
>- A third kind of stationarity, known as intrinsic stationarity, describes the behavior of differences in the spatial process, rather than the data.
- Intrinsic stationarity assumes $E[\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s + h}) -\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s}) ] =0$ then define
$$E[\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s + h}) - \boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s})]^2 = Var(\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s + h}) - \boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s})) = 2 \gamma(\boldsymbol{h}),$$
which only works, and satisfies intrinsic stationarity, if the equation only depends on $\boldsymbol{h}$.

## Variograms
- Intrinsic stationary justifies the use of variograms $2\gamma( \boldsymbol{h})$
- Variograms are often used to visualize spatial patterns:
    - If the distance between points is small, the variogram is expected to be small
    - As the distance between points increases, the variogram increases
- There is a mathematical link between the covariance function $C(\boldsymbol{h})$ and the variogram $2\gamma(\boldsymbol{h})$.

## Isotropy

- If the variogram $2\gamma(\boldsymbol{h})$ depends only on the length of $\boldsymbol{h}$, $||\boldsymbol{h}||,$ and not the direction, then the variogram is isotropic.
- If the direction of $\boldsymbol{h}$ impacts the variogram, then the variogram is anisotropic.

# More about Variograms

## Variogram to the Covariance Function
\begin{eqnarray*}
2 \gamma (\boldsymbol{h}) &=& Var(\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s+h}) - \boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s}))\\
&=& Var(\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s+h})) + Var(\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s})) - 2 Cov(Var(\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s+h}),\boldsymbol{Y}(\boldsymbol{s})))\\
&=&C(\boldsymbol{0}) + C(\boldsymbol{0}) - 2C(\boldsymbol{h})\\
&=& 2 \left[C(\boldsymbol{0}) + C(\boldsymbol{h})\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

- Given $C()$, the variogram can easily be recovered
- Going the other way, $2\gamma() \rightarrow C()$, requires additional assumptions

## Linear semivariogram
<small>$$\gamma(d)=
\begin{cases}
\tau^2 + \sigma^2d \; \; \text{if } d > 0\\
0 \; \; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$</small>

```{r}
tau.sq <- 1
sigma.sq <- 1
d <- seq(0,3, by =.01)
lin.gam <- tau.sq + sigma.sq * d
lin.var <- data.frame(d=d, lin.gam = lin.gam )
ggplot(data = lin.var, aes(x=d, y=lin.gam)) + geom_line() + ylim(0,4) + ylab('linear variogram')
```


## Spherical semivariogram: exercise
$$\gamma(d)=
\begin{cases}
\tau^2 + \sigma^2 \; \; \text{if } d \geq 1/ \phi\\
\tau^2 + \sigma^2\left[\frac{3\phi d}{2} - \frac{1}{2} (\phi d)^3 \right]\\
0 \; \; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
